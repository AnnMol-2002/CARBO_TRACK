CARBO TRACK
==================
## WHAT IT DOES

Our app encourages people to work towards  a sustainable future. We have set up a gamified environment where people can connect with their friends and challenge each other to take steps for an eco-friendly living.
Users can record the actions that they currently do like changing all the lights to  LEDs, using cloth bags for shopping, etc. Depending upon the impact of their actions users can earn coins as rewards.

They can make a list of  goals they plan to achieve and track them. For example, keeping track of their monthly electricity consumption. Instead of just taking inputs from users, our app collects the related documents like electrical bills. An inbuilt scanner scans the bill. With the help of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) the text is automatically recognised and compared to the target they have set for the month. On accomplishing their targets users are rewarded with coins.

Using the coins, they can get rewards like coupons and gifts that can be used in the online shop( exclusively for sustainable products) of the app. The rewards are sponsored by companies that promote those products.

 Users can also view their carbon footprint which is calculated automatically by syncing in their actions using AI


In order to make it a bit exciting there is also a leaderboard that shows the achievements of their friends. The challenge section allows the users to challenge their friends and complete them together.

 The app also provides all the latest news regarding  environment and climate change.
Another feature of the app is an option for donating for causes  that support the environment. Users can also volunteer for various events . The latest news and events are made available using AI. The AI model analyzes the activity of the user in the app and gives suggestions accordingly.

## INSPIRATION

“We are living on this planet as if we had another one to go to.” — Terry Swearingen, Nurse & Winner of Goldman Environmental Prize in 1997
As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report released earlier this year, 
emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are responsible for approximately 1.1°C of warming since 1850-1900, and finds that averaged over the next 20 years, global temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5°C of warming. This assessment is based on improved observational datasets to assess historical warming, as well progress in scientific understanding of the response of the climate system to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.  https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/
This is a reality check for us.

India is  also among the most vulnerable countries to climate change and the states and districts in the eastern part of the country remain even more vulnerable. As the impacts compound and approach a tipping point, it is high time for us to find ways to cope while simultaneously mitigating the climate emergency.

Today sustainable development is not only the need of the hour, but the only way forward towards a livable future. So encouraging people to take up actions that will reduce their carbon footprint becomes crucial. This is the motive behind our app - “Carbo Track”. 
The everyday choices we make all have impacts on our planet.

From the environmental research article here, we can see the various individual actions that can mitigate climate change. https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541

Most times people are unaware of how their small actions can affect the story as a whole. So an app that can monitor and analyze people’s  actions in a fun and engaging way can be motivational and can have a positive impact.


## HOW WE BUILT IT

Our team discussions were conducted via google meet and whatsapp. We exchanged our thoughts on the idea and gave it a proper structure. The design for the prototype of the app was made using  figma. We built the front end of the app using flutter. The website for the app was built using qoom.

## WHAT WE LEARNT

There are a lot of things that we learnt throughout the course of this hackathon. 
- Working as a team
- Designing in figma
- Building website using qoom
- Pushing files into github
- Building the app in flutter

## CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO

- Incorporating all our ideas properly into our prototype:
   Organising and connecting our ideas to design the prototype in figma was a task.
- Building the front end of the app using flutter:
   Pushing the flutter project into github was a bit difficult.
- Hosting the website:
   We faced some issues while deploying the github page.
- Learning the basics of AI and ML technology:
   As we are beginners, it would still take up a lot of time, work and knowledge for the model to be functional. 

## BUILT WITH
- Figma
- Flutter
- Qoom
- Git
- Github


## WHATS NEXT
- Incorporating AI and ML into the model
- Building the back end
- Improve the user interface
